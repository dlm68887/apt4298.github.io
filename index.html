<p style="color:DeepPink;font-size:14pt;">Hi, my name is Avery and I am from Cumming, Georgia. Growing up right outside of the Atlanta area, it had always been my dream to attend UGA. When it came time for my orientation, before I offically began my journey as a student, I was so nervous signing up for classes and picking out a major to study. Going through grade school, I had always been drawn to how/why things are realeased to the public the way that they are. I figured I would pursue that fascination and see where it takes me! Now, I am almost half way through my second year  my second year and I cannot believe how fast time is flying by and how much I enjoy what I am learning. Throughout this site, I hope to get to know a little more about me!</p> 
<p style="color:SteelBlue;"> Currently, I am taking 15 credit hours. It has been a long semester, but this is what my general week looks like: </p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>Since I was little, I have always enjoyed clothing. I think fashion is a great form of expression and really allows people to fully express themselves without having to overtly put themselves out there.</p>
  <p>Since I was in highschool I got very involved with promoting clothing brands. It was really interesting to be involved on the production side of fashion rathe than the purchasing side. Today, I continue to enterain my fascination by working with American Threads, Diffy Eyewear, Brunch Babe, and Simple Beads. </p>

 <p>One of my favorite designers is Coco Chanel. She faced so much adversity altering the conversation of womens clothing. She pioneered the women's suit and so much more. This quote reminds me of the right mind set I should have when I face difficulty. <q>Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future.</q></p>

<h2 style="color:DeepPink;"> Vacation!</h2>
<p style="color:DeepPink;font-size:27pt;"> During holiday breaks, one of my favorite places to go is Turks and Caicos! I have been fortunate enough to frequent Turks and Caicos throughout my childhood! Unfortunately,this year, my family and I will not be able to go due to the distruction of Hurrican Irma.It is really devastating to see wht has happened to one of my favoirte places. The video below shows some of the deastation done to the island.</p>
